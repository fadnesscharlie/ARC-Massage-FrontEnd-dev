    bio: ['I\'ve known I\'ve wanted to become a massage therapist since I was in middle school. I\'m originally from Canada, but grew up here in Renton, and when choosing a massage school I knew RTC would be the best fit for me. RTC was local, affordable, and had an amazing program. In massage school I created a 5 year goal of owning my own business.','I graduated in 2014 and I\'ve worked off and on since then. In 2016 my stepmom was diagnosed with breast cancer and it was at that time I knew I wanted to get certified in breast massage. In 2017, I took a 3 year maternity leave due to high risk pregnancies. In 2022, I officially opened up ARC Massage. I feel like due to my 3 year gap, I still completed my 5 year plan. My specialties are shoulders, glutes, prenatal/postantal, breast/chest, and therapeutic massage.'],
